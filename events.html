    <h2>AP month</h2>
    <img src="picture.PNG"> <img src="appic2.jpg">
    <video controls src="apvid.mp4"></video>
    <p>The most important thing I learned from the event is the importance of protecting our country, especially the West Philippine Sea, and standing against corruption. I realized that being aware of national issues helps me become a responsible Filipino.
I can apply what I learned by being honest, spreading correct information, and caring about our country’s problems.
Yes, I actively joined by making an editorial cartoon about corruption and joining the PopDev Quiz Bee. These helped me learn while also expressing my ideas.
If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain it through real examples and show how these issues affect Filipinos.
It’s important to have events like this because they make learning more interesting and help students understand lessons better through real experiences</p>

    <h2>Buwan ng Wika</h2>
    <img src="buwangwika12.jpg"><img src="buwanngwika1.jpg">
    <video controls src="buwanngwikavid.mp4"></video>
    <p>I tried my best to participate in this event in my own way, like participating in the declamation performance task of my Filipino subject. This may seem as if it’s just a simple task but for me this was a way that I could express my feelings artistically. 

I would describe how beautiful, colorful, and valuable this topic is in a very simple way like its importance and how we can apply it in our everyday life to embrace our true identities in Filipinos so they can understand it.

In my opinion, it is important to have an event per subject because we can focus and learn even deeper through kinesthetic and creative activities. Additionally, we can even learn how to apply the lessons in our everyday life, not just in the classroom setting.
The most important thing I learned from this event is the importance of the Filipino language and our culture as Filipinos. It taught me how our mother tongue could be both a weapon and an art. This month I witnessed how colorful and bright the Filipino culture could be. 

As a Filipino student, I think I apply my learnings everyday. It may be through how I speak, act, and participate in my school community. I like to think of it as if the tongues and cultures of my ancestors are present in spirit in everything that I do. For example, I apply the tradition of respect and hospitality in every encounter and communicating in Filipino with my friends and family.

    <h2>Science Month</h2>
    <img src="sciencee.jpg"><img src="scipic2.jpg">
    <video controls src="scivid.mp4"></video>
    <p>The most important thing I learned during Science Month is the importance of conserving water and protecting our environment. I realized that even small actions can help save our planet.
I can apply what I learned by using water wisely and encouraging others to do the same.
Yes, I actively participated by helping make our WINS corner and joining the photography contest about water conservation, where I was happy to win.
If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain how water is important for life and why we should not waste it.
Events like this are important because they make learning fun and help us understand how science relates to real life.</p>

  <section id="event4">
    <h2>Intramurals</h2>
    <img src="intramz.jpg"> <img src="hai.jpg">
    <video controls src="intramsvid.mp4"></video>
    <p>One of the things that I learned during this month is that you have to have the grit, perseverance, and passion. But most importantly, I learned to value camaraderie, why? Well in every sports event, may it be individual or group, you get to compete against and with each other, and that wouldn’t be possible without unity and friendship. 

One of the ingredients of camaraderie is having the value of understanding and kindness, now you can apply that in real life situations through small and big actions like helping your friends and putting yourself in other people’s shoes before judging.

I actively participated in this event by engaging in the dance prepared by the MAPEH club, through chanting, watching the games, cheering for my team, and playing volleyball for my team.

I would first like to explain to them the values of camaraderie and sportsmanship and how they are linked to the intramurals and challenge them to find the sport they see themselves in, I would also tell them the essence of this activity and how it could build character and memories they will forever cherish.


It’s important to have an event for the MAPEH subject since not everyday do we have activities for physical fitness, through the intramurals, I believe we get a chance to show our excellence in our own sports and to have fun whilst learning with our friends and classmates.

    <h2>Teachers' Day</h2>
    <img src="teacher1.jpg"><img src="TEACHER'S DAY.jpg">
    <video controls src="teachervid.mp4"></video>
    <p>I learned the importance of valuing our teachers for the dedication and hard work they put in their craft because it isn’t easy to show up everyday to teach and it isn’t easy to consistently do it. This event was like a mirror that represented the efforts and the sweat shed by our teachers to provide knowledge for the students.

I could apply my learnings in my everyday life by simply respecting and participating in my teachers’ classes as my own personal token of gratitude for their endless support and hard work.

The event was really short but I participated in my own way by thanking, greeting, and of course, praying for my teachers during the mass to recognize their efforts.

I would tell them the hard work teachers put in their classes and how and why we should show our appreciation and gratitude to them in every way we can.

It’s important to have a teacher’s day event because this shows our appreciation for the teacher's never-ending commitment, dedication, and hard work that they put in teaching their students. This also reminds us, as students, that their jobs aren’t easy as we may perceive them to be, thus we should show respect and gratitude to them in every way we can.
